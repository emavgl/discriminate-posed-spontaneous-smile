# Multimedia Data Security (2017 - UNITN): Discriminate between posed and spontaneous smile

## Abstract
Emotion recognition is a very active research area and it is studied in different fields such as linguistic and visual analysis. This paper will present an implementation of a machine learning classifier that discriminates between posed and spontaneous smiles from videos by analysing visual features. The implementation, based on the paper Recognition of Genuine Smiles by Hamdi DibeklioÄŸlu et al, will be described in different sections of this paper and covers all the steps of the system from the pre-processing to the conclusions.
